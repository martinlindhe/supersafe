# About

supersafe is a small server to be run inside a VM or otherwise controlled
environment.

It serves as a target for running a supplied application,
returning the stdout of the execution.

This is all served over http with no auth, for extra safety.

Intended usage is for probing a Windows vm of how code snippets will execute,
comparing the results to those generated by dustbox-rs.


### Endpoints

/run  - Executes uploaded program and return stdout

curl -F "com=@utils/prober/prober.com" http://supersafe-host:28111/run
